## Premise
Humanity is starving as a result of a worldwide plant disease that has destroyed all crop life. Until animal feed runs out, livestock is the only food source available.  

As supplies run low and desperate people threaten your farm, you play as a desperate, morally questionable farmer fighting to keep yourself alive.

---

## Narrative Summary
- The player keeps their livestock alive by managing a limited supply of animal feed.
- Every night, news reports claim that a "cure" will be available in a certain number of days; however, this is actually a government hoax meant to keep people from becoming alarmed.
- Food supplies start to run low with no chance of restocking once the "cure" doesn't work.   
- Players must make morally challenging decisions like feeding animals to one another, killing livestock, or even feeding human corpses to animals.
- Decisions made in the game are tracked by a **Morality Meter**, which influences endings and survival time:
  - **High Morality:** Harder survival but more humane decisions.  
  - **Low Morality:** Easier survival at the cost of brutal, unethical choices.

## Core Gameplay Loop

### Daily Routine
1. **Day Start:** View dead crop fields.  
2. **Feed Animals:** Allocate limited feed based on animal age and needs.  
3. **Strategize:** Balance resources and moral choices to extend survival.  
4. **Night Events:**  
   - Protect the farm from activists/theives.   
   - Unprompted, find a gun, there aren't many bullets.  
   - Choose whether to use bullets to repel intruders or to kill animals in a humane manner.  
   - Animals must be killed using less humane methods if there are no more bullets left.

### Progression
- As feed runs low, days become more desperate.  
- The player must make tough choices and deal with growing starvation.
- The countdown reaches zero just for their to be no cure.

- **Genre:** Survival strategy with moral decision-making

## Summary

Players are forced to make difficult moral decisions as the game examines the morality and difficulties of surviving in a world where all food has been eradicated except from livestock. All paths lead to the same end, regardless of the decisions made; the struggle lies in *how* you survive and *what* you give up to prolong your life.
