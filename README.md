# Story Summary
Player acts as a morally questionable farmer. Worldwide disease has wiped out all plants from being able to grow. This means that the only food available fot human consumption is animals and meat; though the animal feed in storage will only last so long. The player must manage the feed for each of the animals, which will require different amounts of food based on age and pre-set features. 
Each night in the day/night cycle, the player will see news reports that there will be a "cure" in a certain number of days. However, when those days are up, nothing happens and it was discovered that it was just a scheme from the government to get people to not panic. 
After this, the food will start to run out with no hope for more. Throughout the game, the player will get to make descisions based on a morality meter: e.g. feeding sheep to other sheep, methods of killing the sheep, feeding thief corpses to sheep etc. In every scenario, the player dies, but with a high morality it will be harder to "win" the game, and a low one will make more food and mean the player can live longer. 


# main game loop
Main game loop:
* Player starts showing a field with dead plants
* Player must decide how to feed the sheep for the best outcome (strategy)
* At night, player can find gun (unprompted) and shoot thiefs/"activists" that are trying to steal the sheep from the harmful farming processes and for food.
* (gun will have limited bullets- intended to kill sheep humanely. However, if bullets are used to prevent thieves from stealing sheep, player will be forced to beat a sheep to death instead)
* Player dies either way- either from starvation without killing sheep (shows scene of dead sheep and farmer anyway since the sheep wasnt being looked after) or starvation after eating sheep (morality is depreciated for eating the sheep, but player lives 3 days longer (cutscene of the days left in guilt of killing his only friend, and dies eventually of starvation anyway)
